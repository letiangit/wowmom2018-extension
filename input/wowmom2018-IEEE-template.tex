% The \gls{raw} mechanism proposed by IEEE~802.11ah promises to address one of the major problems of the \gls{iot}: high channel contention in large-scale densely deployed sensor networks. The \gls{raw} feature allows the \gls{ap} to divide stations into different groups, with only the stations in the same group being allowed to access the channel simultaneously. Existing station grouping strategies only support homogeneous scenarios, where all sensor stations have the same fixed data transmission interval, \gls{mcs} and packet size. In this paper, we present two contributions to address this issue. %First, a surrogate model that predicts \gls{raw} performance given specific network conditions and \gls{raw} configuration parameters. It is fast to train and can be solved in real-time. 
% %Second, the \gls{moroa}, which uses the surrogate model to determine the optimal \gls{raw} configuration in real-time, for heterogeneous stations and dynamic traffic.

% %\textcolor{red}{TODO: 1 sentence giving accuracy of the model and performance improvement of the algorithm}

% %In this paper, we propose a model-based RAW optimization algorithm \gls{moroa}  to adapt the RAW parameters in real time for large scale heterogeneous sensor network, in which stations can have different MCSs and packet size based on the service they are providing.  It first utilizes the \gls{sumo} to build a RAW model, which can accurately predict the throughput with given RAW parameters (i.e., RAW duration, RAW slot number and station number assigned to the RAW group). Then it estimates the traffic pattern of each stations by using our previously proposed algorithm \gls{etaroa}. Finally, with the estimated traffic in the network and the built RAW model, we optimize the RAW parameters to achieve the performance required by the scenarios, i.e., throughput or fairness among different types of IoT service. By compare to the simulation results, we verified the built RAW model is quite accurate, and can well represent the behavior of the RAW. The simulation results show that, compare to EDCA/DCF and homogeneous RAW optimization algorithms \gls{taroa}, the MoRoA can highly improve the performance of IEEE 802.11ah networks under heterogeneous traffic in real time. This paper contributes with a practical approach to optimizing RAW grouping for large scale heterogeneous sensor network, which is a major leap towards applying RAW mechanism in real real-life sensor networks.
