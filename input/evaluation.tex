\section{Performance Evaluation and Discussion \label{sec:evaluation}}

This section presents the evaluation results of the \gls{raw} performance of surrogate model and the \gls{moroa} \gls{raw} optimization algorithm. First, the simulation setup is discussed. Second, the accuracy of the surrogate model is compared to simulation results. Finally, \gls{moroa} is evaluated and compared to state of the art \gls{raw} algorithms, as well as the traditional \gls{edca} method of IEEE~802.11.

\subsection{Simulation setup}


% All evaluations are performed using our previously developed 802.11ah ns-3 module~\cite{WNS32016}, based on ns-3 version 3.23. We consider the same IoT scenario as described in section \ref{sec:algorithm},  the default PHY and MAC layer parameters used in our simulation are shown in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}. Concretely,  we consider two types of stations (i.e., HT and LT station as defined in section \ref{sec:SUMO}) co-exists in the one network, each station randomly choose a value X (second) from the range [1, 10] as its transmission interval. We use $\eta$to tune the percentage of the number of each type of station in the whole network, $\eta$, and ($100-\eta$) stations belongs to HT and LT respectively, $\eta=\left[0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1\right]$~\% are evaluated in the experiment. 
   

% RAW performance is evaluated in terms of two metrics: throughput, fairness, and latency. Throughput is calculated as the average number of successfully received payload bytes by the AP per second. Fairness among HT and LT stations are evaluated using Jain's fairness index \cite{jain1984quantitative}. Latency is defined as the average time between a packet entering the transmit queue of the station and being received by the AP. Each simulation runs 600~s . 


All evaluations are performed using our previously developed IEEE~802.11ah ns-3 module~\cite{WNS32016}, based on ns-3 version~3.23. We consider the same \gls{iot} scenario as described in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm}. The same default PHY and MAC layer parameters used as shown in Table~\ref{tab:ns3 parameters}. We consider both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Homogeneous scenarios are used to validate the surrogate model and compare to \gls{etaroa}~\cite{Sensys2017}. In heterogeneous scenarios, half of the stations use the high-throughput (HT) settings and half of them use the low-throughput settings (LT) listed in Table~\ref{tab:ns3 parameters}. The data transmission interval of each station is selected uniformly at random from the interval $\left[1, 10\right]$~seconds.

%RAW performance is evaluated in terms of three metrics: throughput, fairness, and latency. Throughput is calculated as the average number of successfully received payload bytes by the \gls{ap} per second. Fairness between HT and LT stations in terms of packet delivery ratio is evaluated using Jain's fairness index. Latency is defined as the average time between a packet entering the transmit queue of the station and being received by the \gls{ap}. 

\textcolor{red}{RAW performance is evaluated in terms of two metrics: throughput, energy. Throughput is calculated as the average number of successfully received payload bits by the \gls{ap} per second. Energy is considered as the average energy consumption of a successfully received packet.} Each simulation runs for 600~seconds, and all results are averaged over 10 iterations, with the variability of results over these iterations quantified using the standard deviation (SD).



% Run original E-TAROA (one station per slot) until the estimation is stable, then switch to E-TAROA(SUMO). \textcolor{red}{when should the switch happen?}
% \\
% How to switch:\\
% 1. reassign AID based on the transmission interval. Cluster stations based on their AIDs, resulting in:\\
% Interval 1, $n_1$ stations \\
% Interval 2, $n_2$ stations \\
% ... ...\\
% Interval k, $n_k$ stations \\

  \caption{\textcolor{red}{Performance comparison between the surrogate model and simulation results for 2070 random test data points, sorted in ascending order in terms of estimation error}\label{fig:sumo-test-data}}
\end{figure}

In this section we evaluate the training convergence of the surrogate model, as well as its accuracy compared to simulation results. Figure~\ref{fig:sumo-iteraton} plots the model's cross validation score as a function of the number of training samples used. The cross validation score provides a measure for the accuracy of the resulting model. A consistently low score signifies that the training process has converged. 
%Based on this graph, we can conclude that for both the model with high-throughput (HT) and low-throughput (LT) stations, convergence occurs after around $1700$ training samples have been used.
\textcolor{red}{The results show, for the throughput models of both HT and LT stations, that the convergence occurs after around $1700$ training samples have been used. This comes down to about $0.0074$\% of all data points in the input space (i.e., $2.3 \times 10^7$), and about $6.8$\% of the reduced data space (i.e., $25047$) from which samples were drawn during training. The convergence of energy models happens after 1900 and 2500 training samples have been used for energy models of  HT and LT stations, respectively. The training of the HT throughput model and LT energy model stopped after 2370 and 2400 iterations respectively, as it satisfied the cross-validation stop conditions, i.e., 10 consecutive cross-validation scores (2 digits of precision) remain the same. The training of the other models stopped after the maximum number of 2500 iterations, having achieved 15 consecutive cross-validation scores between $0.11$ and $0.12$ for LT throughput model, and 9 consecutive cross-validation scores between $0.054$ and $0.058$ for HT energy model.}  \textcolor{red}{The cross-validation scores decrease as more training samples have been used is due to the sampling strategy FLOLA-Voronoi. It selects points from non-linear regions and the sparsely sampled regions, making the model more and more accurate. It should be noted, the cross-validation scores fluctuate sometimes, that is  because new training samples points are selected from an untouched region, and the surrogate model is  recalculated to consider the new change.}

%In order to ensure no over-fitting occurred, the surrogate model also provides accurate results for data points outside the reduced input space (cf. Table~\ref{tab:sumo parameters}), Figure~\ref{fig:sumo-test-data} plots the absolute error (in terms of throughput) of the surrogate model compared to simulation results. In total, 2070 random data points were generated from all $2.3 \times 10^7$ possible points. The figure also plots the actual simulated throughput of each point, to characterize the significance of the error. For the HT model, the absolute throughput estimation error stays below 0.02~Mbps for the first 2000 points (i.e., $96.6$\% of all data points). The absolute error only goes above $0.1$~Mbps for 3 data points (i.e., $0.14$\%). Similarly, for the LT model, the throughput estimation error stays below $0.004$~Mbps for the first 2000 data points, and only grows above $0.01$~Mbps for the worst 11 data points. In terms of the relative error (i.e., ratio between absolute throughput error and simulation results, not depicted) of the surrogate model compared to simulations, 95\% of all data points have an error below 6.6\% and 5.4\% for the HT and LT model respectively. For both models, 98\% of the data points have a relative error below 10\%. These results validate the ability of the surrogate model to estimate \gls{raw} performance accurately, even for points outside of the reduced input data space used for initial training.

Table~\ref{tab:sumo parameters}), Figure~\ref{fig:sumo-test-data} plots the \gls{cdf} of the relative error (i.e., ratio between absolute error and simulation results). In total, 5000 random data points were generated from all $2.3 \times 10^7$ possible points. It shows around 95\% and 98\% of the test data points has a relative error less than 10\% for the throughput and energy models of LT stations, respectively. Same results are obtained for the HT stations. 90\% of the test data points has a relative error less than 7\% for both throughput and energy models of LT stations, 7\% and 5\% for throughput and energy models of HT stations, respectively. These results validate the ability of the surrogate model to estimate \gls{raw} performance accurately, even for points outside of the reduced input data space used for initial training.}

\end{figure*}

\textcolor{red}{In this section, based on the built model, we analyze the impact of different \gls{raw} configurations on throughout and energy consumption, and the optimal \gls{raw} configuration. For each number of stations, we first find the highest output $t_{max}$ from the built mode $\mathcal{F}_t\left(\cdot\right)$, and find $e_{min}$ from model $\mathcal{F}_e^p \left(\cdot\right)$, which is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:objectiveF}
\mathcal{F}_e^p (n_r, d_r, s_r) =     \frac{ \mathcal{F}_e (n_r, d_r, s_r) \times l_r }{\mathcal{F}_t\left(n_r, d_r, s_r\right) \times T }  
\end{equation}
model $\mathcal{F}_e^p (n_i, d_i, s_i)$ predicts the energy consumption per packet for a \gls{raw} group $r$ with duration $d_r$, consisting of $s_r$ slots, and with $n_r$ stations assigned to it. Subsequently, we select the \gls{raw} configurations that lead to near optimal performance, i.e., throughput higher than 90\% of $t_{max}$, or energy consumption lower than  110\% of $e_{min}$. Figure \ref{fig:ana-throughput}  depicts such \gls{raw} configurations for 100, 200 and 300 LT stations, respectively. As the figures show, for throughput, a small number of stations have more near optimal \gls{raw} configurations, which is straightforward. Since the channel contention is less fierce, fewer \gls{raw} slots number and less transmission time are required for reducing channel contention. Even without \gls{raw} (i.e., one \gls{raw} slot), quite high performance can already be obtained, while \gls{raw} is definitely needed for large number of stations, for example, 200 and 300 stations. It should be noted that, the near optimal \gls{raw} slot number for throughput is discontinuous distributed. For example, for \gls{raw} duration 204.800 ms and 200 stations, slot number [9, 16],  [21, 26] and [40, 50] achieve the highest throughput. It is because a varying number of holding time can be wasted due to the \gls{ncsb} feature \cite{Evgeny2018}. Different from throughput, there is less near optimal \gls{raw} configurations for energy. Moreover, there exists some \gls{raw} configurations that can maximize throughput and minimize energy simultaneously, as depicted in  Figure \ref{fig:sumo-pareto}. It plots the Pareto front of throughput and energy consumption per packet for 100 and 400 LT stations. As it shows, the 400 stations have only one Pareto front solution, i.e., the objective of maximizing throughput and minimizing energy consumption can be achieved simultaneously. While the 100 stations have several Pareto front solutions, different solutions can be chosen based on the preference on each objective.}

%For a certain slot number $s_r$ , once a high throughput can be achieved, a similar throughput can also be obtained with slot number $s_r^{'}$ larger than $s_r$. The reason is, $s_r^{'}$ number leads to less number of stations assigned to one \gls{raw} slot, therefore mitigate the channel contention, and maintain the throughput, or increase the throughput if there are more packets need to be sent. However, there are several exceptions. First of all, if the number of slots is too big, it may cause the \gls{raw} slot duration too short to transmit a single packet. Second,  \todo{the effect of non-cross slot boundary}. While for cross slot boundary, the performance fluctuation does not occur  \cite{WoWMoM2016} and \cite{Zheng2014}. Second, it can be observed that the normalized throughput increases in a fluctuating way as the duration of the RAW slot increases. The reason is that a varying number of mini-slots can be wasted due to the RAW slot handover between groups.


% \begin{enumerate}
% \item There is a set of \gls{raw} slot numbers that can achieve high performance. 
% \item For shorter \gls{raw} duration, there is less options on the \gls{raw} slot number.
% \todo{affected by non cross slot boundary}
% \item For a certain number of stations, there is a requirement on the minimal \gls{raw} duration, denoted as \gls{d_r^{min}}. Any \gls{raw} duration larger than \gls{d_r^{min}}, can leads to higher throughput, with more options on the \gls{raw} slot number.

%In this section we evaluate the performance of \gls{moroa} for homogeneous stations (in terms of \gls{mcs} and packet size) for a variety of traffic loads and station counts. Three different total traffic loads are simulated for the LT scenario, i.e., $T$ = \{0.095, 0.11, 0.15\}~Mbps.  Given the packet payload size and data rate, the maximum throughput that can be achieved is about 0.124~Mbps for LT stations. As such, $T = 0.15$~Mbps represents a near-saturated state, $T = 0.11$~Mbps represents a medium traffic load and $T = 0.095$~Mbps results in low traffic load. %Each station randomly chooses its transmission transmission interval, and the ratio between maximal and minimal transmission interval is up to 20 \cite{Sensor2017}. 
%As \gls{etaroa} was already shown to outperform \gls{edca} for homogeneous stations, we use \gls{etaroa} as a benchmark in this section~\cite{Sensys2017}.

As \gls{etaroa} was already shown to outperform \gls{edca} for homogeneous stations, we use \gls{etaroa} as a benchmark in this section~\cite{Sensys2017}.

%Figure~\ref{fig:sumo-home} depicts performance (i.e., throughput and latency) of \gls{moroa} and \gls{etaroa}. It clearly shows that, compared to \gls{etaroa}, \gls{moroa} improves the throughput under near saturated traffic conditions for any number of stations. At low traffic loads, \gls{moroa} and \gls{etaroa} have the same throughput for any number of stations. Under medium traffic conditions, \gls{moroa} also improves performance for a low number of stations. More importantly, better latency performance is achieved in denser networks. For a low traffic load (i.e., $0.095$~Mbps), \gls{moroa} and \gls{etaroa} have  nearly the same latency when there are less than 1024 stations. However, for 2048 stations, latency of \gls{moroa} is about $32.5$\% lower. For higher traffic loads, \gls{moroa} has better latency even in less dense networks (i.e., starting from 512 and 128 stations for traffic load $0.11$ and $0.15$~Mbps respectively). The above results reveal that, by using surrogate modeling, stations are assigned to RAW groups in a more optimal way. This is due to the fact that \gls{etaroa} derives its optimal \gls{raw} parameters from a model under saturated state as an approximation, rather than optimizing them for different traffic conditions as the surrogate model does. This results in better overall performance in terms of throughput and latency.

It clearly shows that, compared to \gls{etaroa}, \gls{moroa} can tune the values of $\alpha$ to optimize the required performance objective. For $\alpha = 1$, \gls{moroa} improves the throughput up to 4.4\% under near saturated traffic conditions for any number of stations. Under medium traffic conditions, \gls{moroa} also improves performance for a low number of stations. While \gls{moroa} consumes more energy than \gls{etaroa} does for both near saturated and medium traffic conditions. 
%Moreover, \gls{etaroa} has the similar power consumption for both traffic load, while the power consumption of \gls{moroa} increases when the network traffic load changes.

\end{figure*}




In this section, we study the performance of \gls{moroa} in a network with heterogeneous stations. Moreover, we evaluate the effects of the $\alpha$ weight parameter on throughput and \textcolor{red}{energy consumption of both LT and HT stations}, for a variety of network densities. As \gls{etaroa} only supports stations with the same \gls{mcs} and packet size, the results of \gls{moroa} are compared to \gls{edca} in this case. 

%Figure \ref{fig:throughput-alpha} shows that by increasing the value of $\alpha$, higher throughput can be achieved. Between $\alpha=0.25$ and $\alpha=0.5$, throughput increases $22$\%, $36$\%, $44$\% for $1200$, $1400$ and $1600$ stations respectively. While for $\alpha$ less than $0.25$ or larger than $0.5$, the throughput does not significantly change. For the small size networks, it shows there is no need to tune $\alpha$. Figure~\ref{fig:fairness-alpha-percent} illustrates the fairness with different $\alpha$, depicting the same conclusion.  With smaller values of $\alpha$, more fairness is achieved in terms of relative transmitted number of packets between LT and HT stations. Increasing $\alpha$ results in more focus on throughput, resulting in more airtime being provided to the HT stations. %The interesting finding from figure \ref{fig:sumo-alpha} is, although $\alpha$ is defined between 0 and 1, the actual range that affects the results is much smaller. More investigation are needed about tunning the $\alpha$, in order to achieve the required performance, it is considered as  our next step. 

%The comparison between \gls{moroa} and \gls{edca} is depicted in figure \ref{fig:sumo-throughput-csma}. With a small number of stations, \gls{moroa} and \gls{edca} have the same throughput. With more than 600 stations, the throughput of \gls{edca} stagnates to about 0.25~Mbps as the network becomes saturated. However, \gls{moroa} reduces the number of collisions, resulting in better scaling behavior and a higher saturation limit. As a result, for 1800 stations throughput of \gls{moroa} is about 44\% higher for $\alpha=0$ and  $\alpha=0.25$. If more focus is put on the throughput objective, with $\alpha=0.75$, \gls{moroa} more than doubles throughput compared to \gls{edca} in highly dense networks (i.e., 1800 stations), achieving a throughput increase of 108\%. As expected, \gls{edca} achieves high fairness among HT and LT stations due to its random access mechanism. For $\alpha \leq 0.25$ \gls{moroa} achieves a similar degree of fairness. However, for $\alpha = 0.75$ fairness of \gls{moroa} is significantly reduced, as it prioritizes HT stations to maximize overall throughput.

\textcolor{red}{ The comparison between \gls{moroa} and \gls{edca} is depicted in figure \ref{fig:sumo-throughput-csma}. With a small number of stations (i.e., 400 stations), \gls{moroa} and \gls{edca} have the same throughput. While with more than 1000 stations, the throughput of \gls{edca} stagnates to about 0.047~Mbps and 0.21~Mbps for LT and HT stations respectively, as the network becomes saturated. However, for $\alpha = 1$ and $\alpha = 0.75$, \gls{moroa} reduces the number of collisions and results in better scaling behavior and a higher saturation limit. For example, with 1600 stations and $\alpha=0.75$, throughput of \gls{moroa} is about 38\% and 20\% higher for LT and HT stations, respectively. If more focus is put on the throughput objective, with $\alpha=1$, \gls{moroa} achieves about 65\% and 47\% higher throughput for LT and HT stations, respectively. In contrast, when $\alpha = 0$, \gls{moroa} obtain less throughout than \gls{edca} does.
In terms of energy consumption, \gls{moroa} always significantly outperforms \gls{edca}. For  1600 stations with $\alpha = 0$,  \gls{moroa} saves about 96\% and 91\% energy for LT and HT stations, respectively. 
%It should be noted that $\alpha = 0$ and $\alpha = 0.5$ result in the quite similar performance, it is because the range of objective $Q_t$ and $Q_e$ are different. As such, the $\alpha$ can be actually tuned between $0.5$ and $0.1$ to achieve the desired performance.
